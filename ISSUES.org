* BUGS
** TODO context.tool: 'pencil' doesn't show correct cursor on startup.
** TODO penciled shapes must be scaled in ShapeView so they are seen. 

You can only see shapes that are penciled in the top left corner of the canvas.

* FEATURES
** TODO Feature: pencil tool

  Scenario: draw polygon
    Given that the pencil tool is selected
    When I draw a triangle
    Then a new shape should be shown


    
** TODO snap to point on drag
** TODO highlight points on boxselect
    
* QUESTIONS

Do properties really need the excessive nesting?
Should properties<->shape be oneway or twoway?
